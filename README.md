# mergeImages
A simple python script to merge images via pillow.

For a software I need to use big stacks. My data only contain a few, so this create black stacks and can also merge existing stacks with the new stack in the best position.
The image to merged need to be at the same size of background images or smaller. In the case of smaller image, the image is centered.
